Hello! My name is Daeyeon Kim. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Seoul National University (SNU). Starting 2025 spring semester, I'm joining KAIST ME as a M.S. student. My prospective advisor is Prof. Donguk Nam.

Academically I am interested in photonic quantum simulator and aim to research about photonic quantum devices.


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
